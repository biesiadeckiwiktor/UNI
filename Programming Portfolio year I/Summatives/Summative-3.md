# Summative 3

## Challenge Description

"At the New Orleans Oyster Festival, eight eaters will slurp down as many mollusks as they can in the allotted eight minutes. The winner takes home $1,000 from Major League Eating (MLE), which also oversees the ESPN-televised Nathanâ€™s Famous hot dog eating contest on Coney Island every summer." (The world of competitive oyster eating: 'your stomach is like a human Tetris' | Food | The GuardianLinks to an external site.)

You are tasked with writing a program that allows you to enter the number of competitors in the competition, the name of each competitor, and the number of oysters each competitor ate. Once all the competitors are entered you should sort them with respect to the number of oysters eaten (write your own sorting algorithm - do not use the built in sort), output them to the Console and save the results to a file called results.txt.

## Code Listing

```cs
Console.WriteLine("Oyster eating competition");
int competitors = 0;
do
{
    Console.WriteLine("How many competitors are there?");
    competitors = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());

    string[] competitorsNames = new string[competitors];
    int[] oystersEaten = new int[competitors];

    for (int i = 0, j = 1; i < competitors; i++, j++)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("What's competitors number " + j + " name?");
        competitorsNames[i] = Console.ReadLine();

        Console.WriteLine($"How many oysters did {competitorsNames[i]} ate?");
        oystersEaten[i] = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
    }

    int n = oystersEaten.Length;

    int temporaryNumber;

    string temporaryName;

    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) // sorting loop
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++)
        {
            if (oystersEaten[j] < oystersEaten[j + 1])
            {
                temporaryNumber = oystersEaten[j];
                oystersEaten[j] = oystersEaten[j + 1];
                oystersEaten[j + 1] = temporaryNumber;

                temporaryName = competitorsNames[j]; // sorting names at the same time
                competitorsNames[j] = competitorsNames[j + 1];
                competitorsNames[j + 1] = temporaryName;
            }
        }
    }
     //saveing results to file
    using(StreamWriter myFile = new StreamWriter("results.txt"))
    for (int i = 0, j = 1; i < n; i++, j++)
    {
        myFile.WriteLine($"{j}. {competitorsNames[i]} ate {oystersEaten[i]} oysters");
    }
} while (true);
```
