# Summative 6

## Challenge Description

In your digital portfolio repository open the summative 6 project. Note some of the aspects of this exercise will be covered in the upcoming week's labs.

Add a Circle class to the project. Add functionality to the Circle class to achieve the following:

Create a circle by passing a radius.
Create a circle without passing a radius - assigning a value of 1 to the radius (hint - use constructor chaining).
Add a member method that calculates the Area of the Circle.
Add a member method that calculates the Circumference of the Circle.
Give each instance of a Circle a unique ID number.
Add functionality to allow the user to change the Radius of the Circle.
Ensure that the Radius of the Circle CAN NEVER be negative.
Write some code to test you are able to create circles, find their area and circumference, change the radius, and ensure the area and circumference are still correct with the new radius.
